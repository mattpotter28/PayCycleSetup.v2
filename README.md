# Pay Cycle Setup v2

Used to update SQL databses for new restaurants by creating and editing entries in tables holding location information, such as Site Number and ADP Store Codes.

Built using Python, Tkinter, and Pypyodbc. Logs in to the SQL Server by using an encrypted login held in a config file. Builds cleanly into an exe using PyInstaller.
